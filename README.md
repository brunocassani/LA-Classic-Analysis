## Description

A SQL database and Python analysis of the Lancaster Archery Classic Finals over the years. Includes the every year in the men's barebow division. Coming next are the Olympic Recurve and Commpound divisions. Feel free to take any/all of the charts in the charts folder for your own uses! A heads up would be appreciated, but not needed as long as you give due credit.

Additionally, I have published a research paper detailing all the findings, available at [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.13836027](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13836027).
