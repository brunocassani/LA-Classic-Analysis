## Description

A SQL database and Python analysis of the Lancaster Archery Classic Finals over the years. As of now, it only includes the 2022 - 2024 men's barebow division as I have to retrieve the data from the YouTube recordings. As of 15 Sep. 2024, the python graphs are working but not as intended.
